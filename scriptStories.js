		<br>
		A common folkloric story of the origin of candy canes says that in 1670, in Cologne, Germany, the choirmaster at Cologne Cathedral, wishing to remedy the noise caused by children in his church during the Living Crèche tradition of Christmas Eve, asked a local candy maker for some "sugar sticks" for them. In order to justify the practice of giving candy to children during worship services, he asked the candy maker to add a crook to the top of each stick, which would help children remember the shepherds who visited the infant Jesus. In addition, he used the white color of the converted sticks to teach children about the Christian belief in the sinless life of Jesus. From Germany, candy canes spread to other parts of Europe, where they were handed out during plays reenacting the Nativity. The candy cane became associated with Christmastide.`

		story: `A Christmas stocking is an empty sock or sock-shaped bag that is hung on Saint Nicholas Day or Christmas Eve so that Saint Nicholas (or the related figures of Santa Claus and Father Christmas) can fill it with small toys, candy, fruit, coins or other small gifts when he arrives. These small items are often referred to as stocking stuffers or stocking fillers. In some Christmas stories, the contents of the Christmas stocking are the only toys the child receives at Christmas from Santa Claus; in other stories (and in tradition), some presents are also wrapped up in wrapping paper and placed under the Christmas tree. Tradition in Western culture threatens that a child who behaves badly during the year will receive only a piece or pile of coal. Some people even put their Christmas stocking by their bedposts so Santa Claus can fill it by the bed while they sleep.
		<br><br>
		The origin of the Christmas stocking is thought to originate in the life of Saint Nicholas. While there are no written records of the origin of the Christmas Stocking, there are popular legends that attempt to tell the history of this Christmas tradition. One such legend has several variations, but the following is a good example: St. Nicholas was staying with a poor family and heard that the father was planning to sell his three daughters into prostitution to save them all from starvation. St. Nicholas wanted to help, but knew that the old man wouldn't accept charity, so he decided to help in secret. When he left the house after dark he threw three bags of gold through an open window, one landed in a stocking. When the girls and their father woke up the next morning they found the bags of gold and were, of course, overjoyed. The girls were saved from their sad fate. Other versions of the story say that Saint Nicholas threw the three bags of gold directly into the stockings which were hung by the fireplace to dry.
		<br><br>
		This led to the custom of children hanging stockings or putting out shoes, eagerly awaiting gifts from Saint Nicholas. Sometimes the story is told with gold balls instead of bags of gold. That is why three gold balls, sometimes represented as oranges, are one of the symbols for St. Nicholas. And so, St. Nicholas is a gift-giver. This is also the origin of three gold balls being used as a symbol for pawnbrokers.`

As the congregation witnessed a Christmas miracle, the weeds turned into brilliant red and green flowers.
		<br><br>
		Named after Joel Roberts Poinsett, first United States ambassador to Mexico and the amateur botanist who introduced the plant to the U.S. in 1825, the poinsettia is also known as Mexican Flame Leaf, Winter Rose, Noche Buena and, in Turkey, Atakurk's Flower, because it was the favorite flower of Atakurk, the founder of modern Turkey.

		story: `A wreath is an assortment of flowers, leaves, fruits, twigs, or various materials that is constructed to form a circle.
		<br><br>
		In English-speaking countries, wreaths are used typically as household ornaments, most commonly as an Advent and Christmas decoration. They are also used in ceremonial events in many cultures around the globe. They can be worn as a chaplet around the head, or as a garland around the neck.
		<br><br>
		In Christianity, wreaths are used to observe the Advent season, in preparation for Christmastide and Epiphanytide, as well as to celebrate the latter two liturgical seasons. These wreaths, as with other Advent and Christmas decorations, are often set up on the first Sunday of Advent, a custom that is sometimes done liturgically, through a hanging of the greens ceremony. The Advent wreath was first used by Lutherans in Germany in the 16th century, and in 1839, Lutheran priest Johann Hinrich Wichern used a wreath made from a cart wheel to educate children about the meaning and purpose of Christmas, as well as to help them count its approach, thus giving rise to the modern version of the Advent wreath. For every Sunday of Advent, starting with the fourth Sunday before Christmas, he would put a white candle in the wreath and for every day in between he would use a red candle. The use of the Advent wreath has since spread from the Lutheran Church to many Christian denominations,] and some of these traditions, such as the Catholic Church and Moravian Church, have introduced unique variations to it. All of the Advent wreaths, however, have four candles, and many of them have a white candle in the centre, the Christ candle, which is lit on Christmas Day. Advent and Christmas wreaths are constructed of evergreens to represent everlasting life brought through Jesus and the circular shape of the wreath represents God, with no beginning and no end. Advent and Christmas wreaths are now a popular symbol in preparation for and to celebrate the coming of Christ, with the former being used to mark the beginning of the Christian Church's liturgical year and both serving as décor during Advent and Christmas festivities. While Advent wreaths are erected on stands or placed on tables, Christmas wreaths are often hung on doors or walls. Within Advent, the Church observes Saint Lucy's Day, the memorial of Saint Lucy, who is said to have brought "food and aid to Christians hiding in the catacombs" using a candle-lit wreath to "light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible"; as such, on this day, many young Christian girls dress as Saint Lucy, wearing a wreath on their head.`

		story: `Like the Christmas tree, Christmas ornaments originated in Germany. Hans Greiner began to make glass Christmas ornaments called baubles during the 1800s. These were the first manufactured Christmas ornaments, and they were a huge commercial success. As soon as local businesses saw how much potential commercial success Christmas ornaments had, that was that!
		<br><br>
		In the 1890s, Woolworth’s Department Store in the U.S. sold more than $25 million in German-imported ornaments made of lead and hand-blown glass each year. Soon, other countries wanted a piece of the pie. Japan and Eastern European countries were mass-producing glass Christmas ornaments to compete with Germany.
		<br><br>
		In 1973, Hallmark introduced a line of “Keepsake” ornaments that gave Christmas ornaments collectible value. Now, many people will use Christmas ornaments to mark time. For example, you may see ornaments for each year of marriage or a child’s first Christmas.
		<br><br>
		Today, Christmas ornaments may be woven, blown from glass or plastic, molded from porcelain or metal, or carved from wood or expanded polystyrene. They’re created to last and be used year after year. Most people’s collections contain a combination of commercially produced ornaments and items created by family members.`

		picCaption: "Mistletoe",
		story: `Kissing under sprigs of mistletoe is a well-known holiday tradition, but this little plant’s history as a symbolic herb dates back thousands of years. The Greeks were known to use it as a cure for everything from menstrual cramps to spleen disorders, and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder noted it could be used as a balm against epilepsy, ulcers and poisons. 
		<br><br>
		The plant’s romantic overtones most likely started with the Celtic Druids of the 1st century A.D. Because mistletoe could blossom even during the frozen winter, the Druids came to view it as a sacred symbol of vivacity, and they administered it to humans and animals alike in the hope of restoring fertility.
		<br><br>
		Another famous chapter in mistletoe folklore comes from Norse mythology. As the story goes, when the god Odin’s son Baldur was prophesied to die, his mother Frigg, the goddess of love, went to all the animals and plants of the natural world to secure an oath that they would not harm him. 
		<br><br>
		But Frigg neglected to consult with the unassuming mistletoe, so the scheming god Loki made an arrow from the plant and saw that it was used to kill the otherwise invincible Baldur. According to one sunnier version of the myth, the gods were able to resurrect Baldur from the dead. Delighted, Frigg then declared mistletoe a symbol of love and vowed to plant a kiss on all those who passed beneath it.
		<br><br>
		Mistletoe’s associations with fertility and vitality continued through the Middle Ages, and by the 18th century it had become widely incorporated into Christmas celebrations. Just how it made the jump from sacred herb to holiday decoration remains up for debate, but the kissing tradition appears to have first caught on among servants in England before spreading to the middle classes. 
		<br><br>
		As part of the early custom, men were allowed to steal a kiss from any woman caught standing under the mistletoe, and refusing was viewed as bad luck. Yet another tradition instructed the merrymakers to pluck a single berry from the mistletoe with each kiss, and to stop smooching once they were all gone.`

		story: `The custom of burning the Yule Log may goes back to, and before, medieval times. Although the first recorded burning of a 'Christmas Log' was in poetry in 1648. The term 'Yule Log' is first documented in 1686. It seems to have originally been a Nordic tradition. Yule is the name of the old Winter Solstice festivals in Scandinavia and other parts of northern Europe, such as Germany.
		<br><br>
		Yule Logs could have started out an entire tree, or very large log, that was carefully chosen and brought into the house with great ceremony. The largest end of the log would be placed into the fire hearth while the rest of the tree stuck out into the room! The log would be lit from the remains of the previous year's log which had been carefully stored away and slowly fed into the fire through the Twelve Days of Christmas. A smaller log might have been lit each evening through the 12 Days of Christmas. It was considered important that the re-lighting process was carried out by someone with clean hands. Nowadays, of course, most people have central heating so it is very difficult to burn a tree!
		<br><br>
		Different chemicals can be sprinkled on the log like wine to make the log burn with different colored flames!
		<br><br>
		Potassium Nitrate = Violet
		<br>
		Barium Nitrate = Apple Green
		<br>
		Borax = Vivid Green
		<br>
		Copper Sulphate = Blue
		<br>
		Table Salt = Bright Yellow
		<br><br>
		This sounds very dangerous, so please only try this out with some adult supervision!!
		<br><br>
		The ashes of Yule logs were meant to be very good for plants. This is true, because the ash from burnt wood contains a lot of 'potash', which helps plant flowers. But if you throw the ashes out on Christmas day it was supposedly very unlucky!
		<br><br>
		A Chocolate Yule Log or 'Bûche de Noël' is now a popular Christmas dessert or pudding. It's traditionally eaten in France and Belgium, where they are known as 'Kerststronk' in Flemish.
		<br><br>
		They are made of a chocolate sponge roll layered with cream. The outside is covered with chocolate or chocolate icing and decorated to look like a bark-covered log. Some people like to add extra decorations such as marzipan mushrooms!`

		story: `After mistletoe, holly is probably the most festive flower there is. Its evergreen nature means its leaves are more thick-skinned than most other flowers and shrubs, giving it an ability to survive the harshness winter. It has become a symbol of the season, having Christmas carols written about it, while it’s also constantly seen on Christmas cards.
		<br><br>
		But given how many different evergreen plants there are, what makes holly so Christmassy?
		<br><br>
		The link between Christmas and holly can be traced to Roman times, when it was the sacred plant of Saturn. In honour of their god of agriculture, the Romans would send boughs of holly to friends to mark the Saturnalia Festival, celebrated between December 17 and 23 – the darkest time of the year – as well as decorating their homes with garlands of evergreen flowers.
		<br><br>
		They felt that doing so was an appropriate way to anticipate the growth of crops and flowers as winter got ready to change into spring, and as the Romans adopted Christianity, holly became a symbol of Christmas instead.
		<br><br>
		In fact, across northern Europe, the home of the holly plant, Pagans and Druids would also wear holly in wreaths on their heads, in the hope of warding off evil spirits. This was because the plant was believed to possess magical qualities by them.
		<br><br>
		Of course, while holly makes a nice decoration, holly bushes are toxic – consuming too many of its berries can be fatal, and side effects can also include nausea, vomiting and stomach problems. So while holly might be good to look at, remember to be cautious around it, especially with children and pets.

		story: `Christmas tree, an evergreen tree, often a pine, spruce, or fir, decorated with lights and ornaments as a part of Christmas festivities. Christmas trees can be fresh-cut, potted, or artificial and are used as both indoor and outdoor decorations. While the trees are traditionally associated with Christian symbolism, their modern use is largely secular. Many families place presents around an indoor Christmas tree to be opened on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.
		<br><br>
		The use of evergreen trees, wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient Egyptians, Chinese, and Hebrews. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the Devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmastime. It survived further in the custom, also observed in Germany, of placing a Yule tree at an entrance or inside the house during the midwinter holidays.
		<br><br>
		The modern Christmas tree, though, originated in western Germany. The main prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a “paradise tree,” a fir tree hung with apples, that represented the Garden of Eden. The Germans set up a paradise tree in their homes on December 24, the religious feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the eucharistic host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, symbolic of Christ as the light of the world, were often added. In the same room was the “Christmas pyramid,” a triangular construction of wood that had shelves to hold Christmas figurines and was decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star. By the 16th century the Christmas pyramid and the paradise tree had merged, becoming the Christmas tree.
		<br><br>
		The custom was widespread among the German Lutherans by the 18th century, but it was not until the following century that the Christmas tree became a deep-rooted German tradition. Introduced into England in the early 19th century, the Christmas tree was popularized in the mid-19th century by German-born Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. The Victorian tree was decorated with toys and small gifts, candles, candies, popcorn strings, and fancy cakes hung from the branches by ribbons and by paper chains. Taken to North America by German settlers as early as the 17th century, Christmas trees were the height of fashion by the 19th century. They were also popular in Austria, Switzerland, Poland, and the Netherlands. In China and Japan, Christmas trees, introduced by Western missionaries in the 19th and 20th centuries, were decorated with intricate paper designs.
		<br><br>
		Blown-glass ornaments were offered for sale in Britain and the United States as early as the 1870s, many produced in small workshops in Germany and Bohemia, which also created decorations made from tinsel, cast lead, beads, pressed paper, and cotton batting. In the United States, F.W. Woolworth was selling $25 million in ornaments annually by 1890, by which time strings of electric tree lights were also available. In the 1930s, artificial trees made of brush bristles were developed in the United States, and the 1950s and ’60s saw the mass production of aluminum and PVC plastic trees. Artificial trees gained significant popularity, particularly in countries where fresh trees were hard to procure.

		picCaption: "Santa Claus",
		story: `Santa Claus—otherwise known as Saint Nicholas or Kris Kringle—has a long history steeped in Christmas traditions. Today, he is thought of mainly as the jolly man in red who brings toys to good girls and boys on Christmas Eve, but his story stretches all the way back to the 3rd century, when Saint Nicholas walked the earth and became the patron saint of children.
		<br><br>
		The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around A.D. 280 in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. Much admired for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many legends. It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. One of the best-known St. Nicholas stories is the time he saved three poor sisters from being sold into slavery or prostitution by their father by providing them with a dowry so that they could be married. 
		<br><br>
		Over the course of many years, Nicholas’s popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children and sailors. His feast day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death, December 6. This was traditionally considered a lucky day to make large purchases or to get married. By the Renaissance, St. Nicholas was the most popular saint in Europe. Even after the Protestant Reformation, when the veneration of saints began to be discouraged, St. Nicholas maintained a positive reputation, especially in Holland.
		<br><br>
		In 1822, Clement Clarke Moore, an Episcopal minister, wrote a long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,” more popularly known as “‘Twas The Night Before Christmas.” 
		<br><br>
		Moore’s poem, which he was initially hesitant to publish due to the frivolous nature of its subject, is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a “right jolly old elf” with a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney with a mere nod of his head! Although some of Moore’s imagery was probably borrowed from other sources, his poem helped popularize the now-familiar image of a Santa Claus who flew from house to house on Christmas Eve in “a miniature sleigh” led by eight flying reindeer to leave presents for deserving children. “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas” created a new and immediately popular American icon.
		<br><br>
		In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moore’s poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. His cartoon, which appeared in Harper’s Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur, North Pole workshop, elves and his wife, Mrs. Claus.`

		story: `<b>What are Christmas elves?</b>
		<br>
		Christmas elves, sometimes shortened to just 'elves', are tiny, dwarf-like creatures with pointed ears. They live with Santa Claus (or Father Christmas) at the North Pole and help Santa with his workshop.
		<br><br>
		Christmas elves are often perceived as immortal, but with a youthful appearance. They have the power to influence the things you see, do and experience. It's believed that Santa's elves help to keep the workshop hidden from ordinary human eyes!
		<br><br>
		<b>What is the history of Christmas elves?</b>
		<br>
		The history of Christmas elves, and elves in general, has its roots in Germanic, Scandinavian and British folklore.
		<br><br>
		In Germanic paganism, elves were believed to be creatures of light who lived in the heavens. They were later referred to as living underground, as well as in forests, springs and wells.
		<br><br>
		In Scandinavian folklore, elves were house gnomes with magical powers to protect homes from evil spirits. They also used their magical powers to pull pranks on bad people - such as giving them hiccups and bad dreams.
		<br><br>
		It was also believed that if you placed a bowl of porridge in front of your door at night, you'd avoid being the victim of the elves' pranks.
		<br><br>
		During the mid-1800s, various Scandinavian writers helped to paint the picture of what we perceive elves as today. Elaborate Christmas festivals were slowly regaining popularity, and Scandinavian story writers portrayed elves as mischievous fairies who helped out Santa Claus.
		<br><br>
		It was also becoming more popular to refer to the creatures as 'elves' or 'Christmas elves' rather than house gnomes.
		<br><br>
		Louisa May Alcott, an American writer, wrote a book called 'Christmas Elves' in 1856, though it was never published.
		<br><br>
		The image of Christmas elves, with their pointed ears and hats similar to Santa's, was popularised from an illustration on the front cover of the American magazine 'Godey's Lady Book', for its 1873 Christmas issue.
		<br><br>
		<b>Is Santa a Christmas Elf?</b>
		<br>
		How does Santa deliver all those presents in one night? He must be a magical creature like a Christmas elf himself, mustn't he?
		<br><br>
		In fact, in the classic Christmas poem 'A Visit from St Nicholas' (more commonly known as ''Twas the Night Before Christmas'), Santa is described as a 'right jolly old elf'.
		<br><br>
		The figure of Saint Nicholas also became merged with Tomten from Nordic folklore, described as an elfish guardian and having a long white beard, as well as sometimes wearing a red hat.
		<br><br>
		While we'll never know for sure what Santa's elfish heritage may be, it's clear he has some connection with the history of Christmas elves.
		<br><br>
		<b>Where do Santa and the Christmas Elves live?</b>
		<br>
		It's generally believed that Santa and his Christmas elves live in the North Pole in Santa's village; however, it was discovered that there were, in fact, no reindeer living in the North Pole. How can Santa's sleigh fly with no reindeer?
		<br><br>
		This has led many to believe that Santa and his Christmas elves actually live in Lapland, Finland. This area is home to plenty of reindeer that Santa could have recruited his team from.
		<br><br>
		Nobody has seen Santa's secret village and its location is only known to Santa and his crew of elves.
		<br><br>
		<b>Christmas Elves' Duties</b>
		<br>
		Christmas elves working at Santa's workshop have lots of duties and responsibilities. For example, they:
		<br><br>
		- take care of Santa's reindeer;
		<br>
		- guard the secret location of Santa's village and workshop;
		<br>
		-make sure that Santa's sleigh is in working order;
		<br>
		- help Santa keep his Naughty or Nice List in order;
		<br>
		- make toys and organise them onto Santa's sleigh;
		<br>
		- keep an eye on children's behaviour and report back to Santa.`	}

		story: `Angels form a significant part of Christmas legends. In Greek, the word 'angel' means messengers. In the popular Christmas stories, angels are the messengers of God, who played a prominent part in the birth of Lord Jesus Christ. They are personified as heavenly creatures with a pair of wings and a halo. The wings symbolize immortality, virtue, peace, love, cleanliness and innocence, while the halo is the symbol of their native to heaven. Many fairy tales and bedtime stories are centered on them and their good deeds done to humankind. Read on to know more about Christmas angels.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>History</strong><br>
		The history of Christmas angels finds its mention in the New Testament, according to which, angels are categorized into nine ranks, Seraphim and Cherubim holding the top ranks. Saint Michael, an archangel, is regarded as the head of all angels. According to the legends, every human being has his/her own guardian angel, which protects him/her from evil spirits. Angels were perceived as per the Christian doctrine only around 1100-1200 AD. The heavenly creature plays a significant role in Christianity. <br>
		<br>
		According to the popular story of Christmas, angels told Joseph to marry Virgin Mary. Angel Gabriel served as the messenger of the God, who brought the glad news to Virgin Mary about her being chosen as the mother Jesus Christ. Therefore, Gabriel is regarded as a Christmas angel. The Christmas angels also spread the news of the birth of Lord Jesus Christ. Legends say that angels looked over, as Mary and Joseph travel to Bethlehem, when she was bearing the holy child. <br>
		<br>
		When angels came to know about the birth of Lord Jesus Christ, they sang serenade for the newborn baby. They were assigned by the Go to fly closer to earth and sing a melodious song, which was heard in the heavens and throughout the earth. The angels were ecstatic, when they came to know about the birth of Jesus. As per the story, a Christmas angel spread the news of the birth of the Son of God, to the shepherds. Hence, angels have acquired a significant position in the stories and legends connected to Christmas. <br>
		<br>
		<strong>Significance</strong><br>
		When Christmas is round the corner, angels virtually appear everywhere. It is believed that the Christmas angels fill the air with festivity. They are with the human beings, to protect them throughout the festive season. Small children are told bedtime stories, depicting the goodness of angels and their divine relation with human beings. Apart from the fairy tales, angels feature in manger, which depicts the Nativity Scene. The heavenly creatures can be seen in embellishments used for tree as well.
